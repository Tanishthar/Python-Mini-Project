you know About Us
In the modern era, the world is moving towards efficient improvements and productivity using technology. As more and more jobs are being automated, IT department is at par with the changes going around in the world and helps students to gain a strong foothold in the ever-growing modern world. Having the foresight to consider the growth of technology, back in 1999 D.J. Sanghvi college of engineering introduced a new discipline of Information Technology. This program is accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) till A.Y. 2022- 2023 (i.e., till 30th June 2023). In other words, IT deals with the use of computers and software to provide a new tangent all together in the technology, to convert, store, protect, process, transmit and retrieve information, securely. To keep pace with the current technological trends and to sharpen their skills, faculty development workshops are carried out regularly. During this four-year program, the emphasis is on the technology itself more than on the information it conveys. A highly skilled, dynamic, and technologically sound faculty endows the IT department. IT students have striven hard to achieve many awards and laurels for the college and many of the alumnus work for big MNCs. The IT department boasts of having two student committees, namely DJ-CSI and INIT-AI. These committees aim to not only give students opportunities to advance academically but also to hone their overall skills. DJCSI bagged the award of the best CSI chapter in India for the academic year 2017-19.
Students at our department are always encouraged to participate in research projects and research assignments not only under the competent faculty in the department but also with renowned organizations outside e.g., CDAC, IIT-Bombay etc. Students at our department are also motivated to contribute their research publications in renowned journal and conferences. Students also get a chance to not only participate in the coding competitions and hackathons but they are also actively involved in organizing such prestigious events as well. Through all these activities, students get a good exposure to earn strong technical and non-technical skills that help them to build their impressive profile for their candidature application at foreign universities and other PG programs. Competent faculty in the department provides every possible assistance to students in their academic and research work for this process. Strong recommendation from the faculty have always played a vital role in students grabbing the best and their ambitious admits for higher studies opportunities at the prestigious universities.

Rough work must be done only in the space marked “Rough Work.”

Do not write anything on the question paper.

No communication with fellow students once inside the exam hall.

Malpractice or any unfair means will result in disciplinary action and may lead to cancellation of exam.

For Practical/Oral/Project Exams:

Ensure project documents and code are ready and can be demonstrated as required.

Be punctual and follow instructions by the examiner.

Dress appropriately and behave professionally.

Exam Absence/Medical Cases:

Make-up exam requests will be considered only with prior permission or emergency documentation.

Ensure that all supplementary sheets are securely tied.

Attendance Policy – DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering
Minimum Attendance Requirement:

Students must maintain at least 75% attendance in each course (theory and practical separately) during the semester.

This is mandatory to be eligible for appearing in university/college examinations.

Defaulter List:

A Defaulter List is displayed twice each semester:

Mid-Semester Defaulter List

Final Defaulter List (FDL)

Students listed in the Final Defaulter List may be debarred from appearing in internal assessments, practicals, or university exams for that course.

Improvement Opportunity:

Improvement Week (IW) is scheduled before exams to allow students to improve participation (if permitted by the department).

Medical or Exceptional Cases:

Students must submit a valid medical certificate or supporting documents within 3 working days in case of health or personal emergencies.

The department/college authorities will review and may grant relaxation at their discretion.

Consequences of Poor Attendance:

Ineligibility for university examinations.

Risk of year loss or re-registration of the course in the following semester/year.

Monitoring & Communication:

Students are advised to regularly check their attendance status through the ERP/student portal.

No separate notice will be sent to individuals—tracking is the student’s responsibility.


Focus on these topics:
1. Course information (registration, requirements, schedules)
2. Faculty details (office hours, contact information)
3. Exam policies and schedules
4. University policies and procedures`;
